# Weather_Map_with_APIs_and_JSON
Search for the current weather in any city.  

This console application uses APIs and JSON to call and parse an object into strings which are presented as the current temperature, a "feels like" temperature, and a description of the weather such as sunny.  The console application also offers the user the ability to convert the temperature to celsius.
